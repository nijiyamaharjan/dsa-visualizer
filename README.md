## ALGORITHMS VISUALIZER USING REACT
A tool to visualize algorithms for sorting, graph and tree. This project was done as part of our course for Data Structure And Algorithm (DSA) (CT 552)

# Features
- Choose from a total of 9 major algorithms visualized
- Animation controls including play,pause, skip forward/backward for sorting algorithms
- Colour coded process for easy identification of ungoing action
- Same graph can be traversed using different algorithms once created
