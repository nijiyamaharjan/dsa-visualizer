## ALGORITHMS VISUALIZER USING REACT
https://nijiyamaharjan.github.io/dsa-visualizer/

A tool to visualize algorithms for sorting, graph and tree. This project was done as part of our course for Data Structure And Algorithm (DSA) (CT 552)

# Features
- Choose from a total of 9 major algorithms visualized
- Animation controls including play,pause, skip forward/backward for sorting algorithms
- Colour coded process for easy identification of ongoing action
- Same graph can be traversed using different algorithms once created
